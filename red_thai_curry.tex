\begin{recipe}{Thai Red Curry}
  \servings{3}

  \begin{ingredients}
    \ingredient{3}{}{chicken thighs}
    \ingredient{}{}{flour}
    \ingredient{1}{tbsp}{butter}
    \ingredientsep
    \ingredient{8}{oz}{coconut milk}
    \ingredient{1}{tbsp}{thai curry powder}
  \end{ingredients}

  \begin{steps}
  \item Dry the chicken and coat it in flour.
  \item Set a pan on high and put the chicken skin-side down into the
    butter.
  \item Render the chicken skin.
  \item Add some water and the coconut milk to the pan and braise
    until the chicken is tender (15 minutes).
  \end{steps}

  \begin{notes}
  \item This was horrible.
  \item I shouldn't have put any flour, butter, or oil in the pan.
    The skin didn't render correctly and was pretty much inedible.  I
    think maybe just medium-high might help a bit.
  \item The sauce was not flavorful at all, more curry powder at a
    minimum.
  \item The chicken needs to cook longer.
