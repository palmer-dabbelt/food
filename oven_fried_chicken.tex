  \begin{steps}
  \item Trim and dry the chicken, particularly the skin side.
  \item Mix together all the spices and coat the wings with them.
  \item Place the chicken skin-side up on a baking rack.
  \item Bake the chicken at 450\degree F for 45 minutes.
  \item Remove the wings to rest while making a sauce.
  \item Add the wine to the hot roasting pan to deglaze it, serve the
    chicken with the roasting juices.
  \end{steps}

  \begin{notes}
  \item I think these should be roasted on top of some vegetables to
    get a better sauce, last time it was too thin and acidic.
