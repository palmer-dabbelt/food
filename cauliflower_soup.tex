  \servings{4}

  \begin{ingredients}
    \ingredient{1}{tbsp}{butter}
    \ingredient{1}{large}{yellow (Spanish) onion}
    \ingredient{3}{cloves}{garlic}
    \ingredient{1}{head}{califlour}
    \ingredient{\quarter}{cube}{beef stock cube}
  \end{ingredients}

  \begin{steps}
  \item Melt butter in a pot that'll fit everything but don't get it
    too hot.
  \item Slice the onion somewhat small-ish (not super important, it'll
    be blended) and put it in the butter.
  \item Wait for the onion to cook some.  Don't get it brown, just a
    bit translucent.
  \item Crush the garlic and put it in the pot, get it cooked fairly
    well (a bit brown).
  \item Make sure there's some water in the pot from cooking the
    onions, if not add a tiny bit (just to make sure things are wet).
  \item Cut the cauliflour into small-ish chunks (maybe 1'' cube or
    so) and add it to the pot.
  \item Put the top on the pot and cook it until the cauliflour is
    easy to smash with a spoon.  If you've covered it tight it'll be
    very wet at this point, otherwise add water (or more realistically
    just throw it out as it's probably burned -- get a better lid!).
  \item Blend the cooked vegetable mixture until smooth.
