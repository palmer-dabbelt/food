  \begin{steps}
  \item Peel and clean the shrimp
  \item Boil the water and cook the pasta
  \item Melt the butter and oil in a hot frying pan
  \item Toss in the shrimp and cook for a few seconds on one side
  \item Flip the shrimp and add salt and garlic powder
  \item Remove the shrimp from the pan to a plate
  \item Toss the noodles in the remaining oil from the pasta
  \end{steps}

  \begin{notes}
  \item This turned out OK, but not great.  I think part of the
    problem was the shrimp (which had been re-frozen), but part of the
    problem was lack of sauce.  I'd underseasoned the noodles, which
    may have solved the problem, but I think tossing in some wine to
    deglaze the pan may have helped too (though there's not really
    anything to deglaze).
  \item Picture are 12oz of shrimp on 4oz of pasta, so a lot shrimpier
    than normal!
